# Function and method signatures

Function signatures in this standard adhere to the following:

1. Positional parameters must be
   [positional-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570/) parameters.
   Positional-only parameters have no externally-usable name. When a function
   accepting positional-only parameters is called, positional arguments are
   mapped to these parameters based solely on their order.

   _Rationale: existing libraries have incompatible conventions, and using names
   of positional parameters is not normal/recommended practice._

    ```{note}

    Positional-only parameters are only available in Python >= 3.8. Libraries
    still supporting 3.7 or 3.6 may consider making the API standard-compliant
    namespace >= 3.8. Alternatively, they can add guidance to their users in the
    documentation to use the functions as if they were positional-only. 
    ```

2. Optional parameters must be
   [keyword-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/) arguments.

   _Rationale: this leads to more readable code, and it makes it easier to
   evolve an API over time by adding keywords without having to worry about
   keyword order._

3. For functions that have a single positional array parameter, that parameter
   is called `x`. For functions that have multiple array parameters, those
   parameters are called `xi` with `i = 1, 2, ...` (i.e., `x1`, `x2`).

4. Type annotations are left out of the signatures themselves for readability;
   they are added to the descriptions of individual parameters however. In code
   which aims to adhere to the standard, adding type annotations is strongly
   recommended.

A function signature and description will look like:

```
funcname(x1, x2, /, *, key1=-1, key2=None)

    Parameters

    x1 : array
        description
    x2 : array
        description
    key1 : int
        description
    key2 : Optional[str]
        description

    Returns

    out : array
        description
```

Method signatures will follow the same conventions and, modulo the addition of
`self`.

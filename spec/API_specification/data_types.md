# Data Types

> Array API specification for supported data types.

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must provide and support the following data types.

## bool

Boolean (`True` or `False`).

## int8

An 8-bit signed integer whose values exist on the interval `[-128, +127]`.

## int16

A 16-bit signed integer whose values exist on the interval `[−32,767, +32,767]`.

## int32

A 32-bit signed integer whose values exist on the interval `[−2,147,483,647, +2,147,483,647]`.

## int64

A 64-bit signed integer whose values exist on the interval `[−9,223,372,036,854,775,807, +9,223,372,036,854,775,807]`.

## uint8

An 8-bit unsigned integer whose values exist on the interval `[0, +255]`.

## uint16

A 16-bit unsigned integer whose values exist on the interval `[0, +65,535]`.

## uint32

A 32-bit unsigned integer whose values exist on the interval `[0, +4,294,967,295]`.

## uint64

A 64-bit unsigned integer whose values exist on the interval `[0, +18,446,744,073,709,551,615]`.

## float32

IEEE 754 single-precision (32-bit) binary floating-point number (see IEEE 754-2019).

## float64

IEEE 754 double-precision (64-bit) binary floating-point number (see IEEE 754-2019).


:::{admonition} Future extension
:class: hint
`complex64` and `complex128` dtypes are expected to be included in the next
version of this standard and to have the following casting rules (will be added
to {ref}`type-promotion`):

```{note}
A conforming implementation of the array API standard may provide and support additional data types beyond those described in this specification.
```

(data-type-objects)=
## Data Type Objects

Data types ("dtypes") are objects which are used as `dtype` specifiers in functions and methods (e.g., `zeros((2, 3), dtype=float32)`).

```{note}
A conforming implementation may add additional methods or attributes to data type objects beyond those described in this specification.
```

```{note}
Implementations may provide other ways to specify data types (e.g., `zeros((2, 3), dtype='f4')`) which are not described in this specification; however, in order to ensure portability, array library consumers are recommended to use data type objects as provided by specification conforming array libraries.
```

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must provide and support data type objects having the following attributes and methods.

### Methods

<!-- NOTE: please keep the methods in alphabetical order -->

(data-type-method-__eq__)=
### \_\_eq\_\_(self, other, /)

Computes the truth value of `self == other` in order to test for data type object equality.

#### Parameters

-   **self**: _&lt;dtype&gt;_

    -   data type instance. May be any supported data type.

-   **other**: _&lt;dtype&gt;_

    -   other data type instance. May be any supported data type.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _&lt;bool&gt;_

    -   a boolean indicating whether the data type objects are equal.

(data-type-defaults)=
## Default Data Types

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must define a default floating-point data type (either `float32` or `float64`) and a default integer data type (`int32` or `int64`).

The default data types must be the same across platforms.

The default integer data type may vary depending on whether Python is 32-bit or 64-bit.

```{note}
The default floating-point and integer data types should be clearly defined in a conforming library's documentation.
```

(data-type-categories)=
## Data Type Categories

For the purpose of organizing functions within this specification, the following data type categories are defined.

```{note}
Conforming libraries are not required to organize dtypes according to these categories. These
categories are only intended for use within this specification.
```

```{note}
Future versions of the specification will include additional categories for
complex data types.
```

### Numeric Data Types

`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`,
`uint64`, `float32`, and `float64` (i.e., all dtypes except for `bool`).

### Integer Data Types

`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and
`uint64`.

### Floating-point Data Types

`float32` and `float64`.

### Boolean Data Types

`bool`.

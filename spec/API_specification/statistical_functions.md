# Statistical Functions

> Array API specification for statistical functions.

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must provide and support the following functions adhering to the following conventions.

-   Positional parameters must be [positional-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570/) parameters. Positional-only parameters have no externally-usable name. When a function accepting positional-only parameters is called, positional arguments are mapped to these parameters based solely on their order.
-   Optional parameters must be [keyword-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/) arguments.
-   The `out` keyword argument must follow the conventions defined in :ref:`out-keyword`.
-   Broadcasting semantics must follow the semantics defined in :ref:`broadcasting`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, functions must support the data types defined in :ref:`data-types`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, functions must adhere to the type promotion rules defined in :ref:`type-promotion`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, floating-point operations must adhere to IEEE 754-2019.

<!-- NOTE: please keep the functions in alphabetical order -->

When computing the standard deviation of a population, setting this parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire population).

Default: `0`.

When computing the variance of a population, setting this parameter to `0` is the standard choice (i.e., the provided array contains data constituting an entire population).

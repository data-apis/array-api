# Linear Algebra Functions

> Array API specification for linear algebra functions.

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must provide and support the following functions adhering to the following conventions.

-   Positional parameters must be [positional-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570/) parameters. Positional-only parameters have no externally-usable name. When a function accepting positional-only parameters is called, positional arguments are mapped to these parameters based solely on their order.
-   Optional parameters must be [keyword-only](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/) arguments.
-   Broadcasting semantics must follow the semantics defined in {ref}`broadcasting`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, functions must support the data types defined in {ref}`data-types`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, functions must adhere to the type promotion rules defined in {ref}`type-promotion`.
-   Unless stated otherwise, floating-point operations must adhere to IEEE 754-2019.

        | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
        | 0                | -                               | sum(a != 0)                    |
        | -1               | min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))        | 1./sum(1./abs(a))              |
        | -2               | smallest singular value         | 1./sqrt(sum(1./abs(a)\*\*2))   |
        | -inf             | min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))        | min(abs(a))                    |
        | (int,float < 1)  | -                               | sum(abs(a)\*\*ord)\*\*(1./ord) |

        When `ord` is `None`, the following norms must be the default norms:

        | ord              | matrix                          | vector                     |
        | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

        where `fro` corresponds to the **Frobenius norm**, `nuc` corresponds to the **nuclear norm**, and `-` indicates that the norm is **not** supported.

        For matrices,

        -   if `ord=1`, the norm corresponds to the induced matrix norm where `p=1` (i.e., the maximum absolute value column sum).
        -   if `ord=2`, the norm corresponds to the induced matrix norm where `p=inf` (i.e., the maximum absolute value row sum).
        -   if `ord=inf`, the norm corresponds to the induced matrix norm where `p=2` (i.e., the largest singular value).

        If `None`,

        -   if matrix (or matrices), the function must compute the Frobenius norm.
        -   if vector (or vectors), the function must compute the L2-norm (Euclidean norm).

    -   second input array. Must be compatible with `x1` (see {ref}`broadcasting`). Should have a numeric data type.

-   **axes**: _Union\[ int, Tuple\[ Sequence\[ int ], Sequence\[ int ] ] ]_

    -   number of axes (dimensions) to contract or explicit sequences of axes (dimensions) for `x1` and `x2`, respectively.
       
        If `axes` is an `int` equal to `N`, then contraction must be performed over the last `N` axes of `x1` and the first `N` axes of `x2` in order. The size of each corresponding axis (dimension) must match. Must be nonnegative.

        -   If `N` equals `0`, the result is the tensor (outer) product.
        -   If `N` equals `1`, the result is the tensor dot product.
        -   If `N` equals `2`, the result is the tensor double contraction (default).
       
        If `axes` is a tuple of two sequences `(x1_axes, x2_axes)`, the first sequence must apply to `x` and the second sequence to `x2`. Both sequences must have the same length. Each axis (dimension) `x1_axes[i]` for `x1` must have the same size as the respective axis (dimension) `x2_axes[i]` for `x2`. Each sequence must consist of unique (nonnegative) integers that specify valid axes for each respective array.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   an array containing the tensor contraction whose shape consists of the non-contracted axes (dimensions) of the first array `x1`, followed by the non-contracted axes (dimensions) of the second array `x2`. The returned array must have a data type determined by {ref}`type-promotion`.

(function-linalg-svdvals)=
### linalg.svdvals(x, /)

Computes the singular values of a matrix (or a stack of matrices) `x`.

#### Parameters

-   **x**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   input array having shape `(..., M, N)` and whose innermost two dimensions form matrices on which to perform singular value decomposition. Should have a floating-point data type.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _Union\[ &lt;array&gt;, Tuple\[ &lt;array&gt;, ... ] ]_

    -   an array with shape `(..., K)` that contains the vector(s) of singular values of length `K`. For each vector, the singular values must be sorted in descending order by magnitude, such that `s[..., 0]` is the largest value, `s[..., 1]` is the second largest value, et cetera. The first `x.ndim-2` dimensions must have the same shape as those of the input `x`. The returned array must have the same floating-point data type as `x`.

(function-trace)=
### trace(x, /, *, axis1=0, axis2=1, offset=0)

Returns the sum along the specified diagonals. If `x` has more than two dimensions, then the axes (dimensions) specified by `axis1` and `axis2` are used to determine the two-dimensional sub-arrays for which to compute the trace.

#### Parameters

-   **x**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   input array. Must have at least `2` dimensions. Should have a numeric data type.

-   **axis1**: _int_

    -   first axis (dimension) with respect to which to compute the trace. Default: `0`.

-   **axis2**: _int_

    -   second axis (dimension) with respect to which to compute the trace. Default: `1`.

-   **offset**: _int_

    -   offset specifying the off-diagonal relative to the main diagonal.

        -   `offset = 0`: the main diagonal.
        -   `offset > 0`: off-diagonal above the main diagonal.
        -   `offset < 0`: off-diagonal below the main diagonal.

        Default: `0`.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   if `x` is a two-dimensional array, the returned array must be a zero-dimensional array containing the trace; otherwise, the returned array must be a multi-dimensional array containing the traces.

        The shape of a multi-dimensional output array is determined by removing `axis1` and `axis2` and storing the traces in the last array dimension. For example, if `x` has rank `k` and shape `(I, J, K, ..., L, M, N)` and `axis1=-2` and `axis1=-1`, then a multi-dimensional output array has rank `k-2` and shape `(I, J, K, ..., L)` where

        ```text
        out[i, j, k, ..., l] = trace(a[i, j, k, ..., l, :, :])
        ```

        The returned array must have the same data type as `x`.

(function-transpose)=
### transpose(x, /, *, axes=None)

Transposes (or permutes the axes (dimensions)) of an array `x`.

#### Parameters

-   **x**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   input array.

-   **axes**: _Optional\[ Tuple\[ int, ... ] ]_

    -   tuple containing a permutation of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` where `N` is the number of axes (dimensions) of `x`. If `None`, the axes (dimensions) must be permuted in reverse order (i.e., equivalent to setting `axes=(N-1, ..., 1, 0)`). Default: `None`.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   an array containing the transpose. The returned array must have the same data type as `x`.

(function-vecdot)=
### vecdot(x1, x2, /, *, axis=None)

Computes the (vector) dot product of two arrays.

#### Parameters

-   **x1**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   first input array. Should have a numeric data type.

-   **x2**: _&lt;array&gt;_

    -   second input array. Must be compatible with `x1` (see {ref}`broadcasting`). Should have a numeric data type.

-   **axis**: _Optional\[ int ]_

    -   axis over which to compute the dot product. Must be an integer on the interval `[-N, N)`, where `N` is the rank (number of dimensions) of the shape determined according to {ref}`broadcasting`. If specified as a negative integer, the function must determine the axis along which to compute the dot product by counting backward from the last dimension (where `-1` refers to the last dimension). If `None`, the function must compute the dot product over the last axis. Default: `None`.

#### Returns

-   **out**: _&lt;array;&gt;_

    -   if `x1` and `x2` are both one-dimensional arrays, a zero-dimensional containing the dot product; otherwise, a non-zero-dimensional array containing the dot products and having rank `N-1`, where `N` is the rank (number of dimensions) of the shape determined according to {ref}`broadcasting`. The returned array must have a data type determined by {ref}`type-promotion`.

#### Raises

-   if provided an invalid `axis`.
-   if the size of the axis over which to compute the dot product is not the same for both `x1` and `x2`.

# Constants

> Array API specification for constants.

A conforming implementation of the array API standard must provide and support the following constants adhering to the following conventions.

-   Each constant must have a Python floating-point data type (i.e., `float`) and be provided as a Python scalar value.

<!-- NOTE: please keep the constants in alphabetical order -->

In order to reverse all axes, one is recommended to use the functional ``permute_dims`` interface found in this specification.

        stream: Optional[Union[int, Any]]
            for CUDA and ROCm, a Python integer representing a pointer to a stream, on devices that support streams. ``stream`` is provided by the consumer to the producer to instruct the producer to ensure that operations can safely be performed on the array (e.g., by inserting a dependency between streams via "wait for event"). The pointer must be a positive integer or ``-1``. If ``stream`` is ``-1``, the value may be used by the consumer to signal "producer must not perform any synchronization". The ownership of the stream stays with the consumer. On CPU and other device types without streams, only ``None`` is accepted.

            For other device types which do have a stream, queue or similar synchronization mechanism, the most appropriate type to use for ``stream`` is not yet determined. E.g., for SYCL one may want to use an object containing an in-order ``cl::sycl::queue``. This is allowed when libraries agree on such a convention, and may be standardized in a future version of this API standard.


        .. note::
            Support for a ``stream`` value other than ``None`` is optional and implementation-dependent.

            - ``> 2``: stream number represented as a Python integer.
            - ``0`` is disallowed due to its ambiguity: ``0`` could mean either ``None``, ``1``, or ``2``.

        .. admonition:: Tip
            :class: important

            It is recommended that implementers explicitly handle streams. If
            they use the legacy default stream, specifying ``1`` (CUDA) or ``0``
            (ROCm) is preferred. ``None`` is a safe default for developers who do
            not want to think about stream handling at all, potentially at the
            cost of more synchronization than necessary.

        .. note::
           For input arrays which promote to an integer data type, the result of division by zero is unspecified and thus implementation-defined.

        **Special cases**

        .. note::
            Floor division was introduced in Python via `PEP 238 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/>`_ with the goal to disambiguate "true division" (i.e., computing an approximation to the mathematical operation of division) from "floor division" (i.e., rounding the result of division toward negative infinity). The former was computed when one of the operands was a ``float``, while the latter was computed when both operands were ``int``s. Overloading the ``/`` operator to support both behaviors led to subtle numerical bugs when integers are possible, but not expected.

            To resolve this ambiguity, ``/`` was designated for true division, and ``//`` was designated for floor division. Semantically, floor division was `defined <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/#semantics-of-floor-division>`_ as equivalent to ``a // b == floor(a/b)``; however, special floating-point cases were left ill-defined.

            Accordingly, floor division is not implemented consistently across array libraries for some of the special cases documented below. Namely, when one of the operands is ``infinity``, libraries may diverge with some choosing to strictly follow ``floor(a/b)`` and others choosing to pair ``//`` with ``%`` according to the relation ``b = a % b + b * (a // b)``. The special cases leading to divergent behavior are documented below.

            This specification prefers floor division to match ``floor(divide(x1, x2))`` in order to avoid surprising and unexpected results; however, array libraries may choose to more strictly follow Python behavior.

        For floating-point operands, let ``self`` equal ``x1`` and ``other`` equal ``x2``.

        -   If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
        -   If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
        -   In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the greatest (i.e., closest to ``+infinity``) representable integer-value number that is not greater than the division result. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self: array
            array instance whose elements correspond to the exponentiation base. Should have a real-valued data type.
        other: Union[int, float, array]
            other array whose elements correspond to the exponentiation exponent. Must be compatible with ``self`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Should have a real-valued data type.

        Returns
        -------
        out: array
            an array containing the element-wise results. The returned array must have a data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.


        .. note::
           Element-wise results must equal the results returned by the equivalent element-wise function :func:`~array_api.pow`.
        """

    def __rshift__(self: array, other: Union[int, array], /) -> array:
        """
        Evaluates ``self_i >> other_i`` for each element of an array instance with the respective element of the array ``other``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self: array
            array instance. Should have an integer data type.
        other: Union[int, array]
            other array. Must be compatible with ``self`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Should have an integer data type. Each element must be greater than or equal to ``0``.

        Returns
        -------
        out: array
            an array containing the element-wise results. The returned array must have the same data type as ``self``.


        .. note::
           Element-wise results must equal the results returned by the equivalent element-wise function :func:`~array_api.bitwise_right_shift`.

    def __setitem__(self: array, key: Union[int, slice, ellipsis, Tuple[Union[int, slice, ellipsis], ...], array], value: Union[int, float, bool, array], /) -> None:
        """
        Sets ``self[key]`` to ``value``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self: array
            array instance.
        key: Union[int, slice, ellipsis, Tuple[Union[int, slice, ellipsis], ...], array]

            value(s) to set. Must be compatible with ``self[key]`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`).


        .. note::

           Setting array values must not affect the data type of ``self``.

           When ``value`` is a Python scalar (i.e., ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``), behavior must follow specification guidance on mixing arrays with Python scalars (see :ref:`type-promotion`).

           When ``value`` is an ``array`` of a different data type than ``self``, how values are cast to the data type of ``self`` is implementation defined.

        Calculates the difference for each element of an array instance with the respective element of the array ``other``. The result of ``self_i - other_i`` must be the same as ``self_i + (-other_i)`` and must be governed by the same floating-point rules as addition (see :meth:`array.__add__`).

        Parameters
        ----------

    def __truediv__(self: array, other: Union[int, float, array], /) -> array:
        """
        Evaluates ``self_i / other_i`` for each element of an array instance with the respective element of the array ``other``.

        .. note::
           If one or both of ``self`` and ``other`` have integer data types, the result is implementation-dependent, as type promotion between data type "kinds" (e.g., integer versus floating-point) is unspecified.

           Specification-compliant libraries may choose to raise an error or return an array containing the element-wise results. If an array is returned, the array must have a real-valued floating-point data type.

        **Special cases**

        For floating-point operands, let ``self`` equal ``x1`` and ``other`` equal ``x2``.

        -   If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is `NaN`.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``-0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
        -   If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
        -   If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
        -   In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

        Parameters
        ----------

            array instance. Should have an integer or boolean data type.
        other: Union[int, bool, array]

    def to_device(self: array, device: Device, /, *, stream: Optional[Union[int, Any]] = None) -> array:
        """
        Copy the array from the device on which it currently resides to the specified ``device``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self: array
            array instance.
        device: device
            a ``device`` object (see :ref:`device-support`).
        stream: Optional[Union[int, Any]]
            stream object to use during copy. In addition to the types supported in :meth:`array.__dlpack__`, implementations may choose to support any library-specific stream object with the caveat that any code using such an object would not be portable.

        Returns
        -------
        out: array
            an array with the same data and data type as ``self`` and located on the specified ``device``.


        .. note::
           If ``stream`` is given, the copy operation should be enqueued on the provided ``stream``; otherwise, the copy operation should be enqueued on the default stream/queue. Whether the copy is performed synchronously or asynchronously is implementation-dependent. Accordingly, if synchronization is required to guarantee data safety, this must be clearly explained in a conforming library's documentation.

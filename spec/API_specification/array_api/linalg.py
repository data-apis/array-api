    """
    Computes the vector norm of a vector (or batch of vectors) ``x``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array. Should have a floating-point data type.
    axis: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, ...]]]
        If an integer, ``axis`` specifies the axis (dimension) along which to compute vector norms. If an n-tuple, ``axis`` specifies the axes (dimensions) along which to compute batched vector norms. If ``None``, the vector norm must be computed over all array values (i.e., equivalent to computing the vector norm of a flattened array). Negative indices must be supported. Default: ``None``.
    keepdims: bool
        If ``True``, the axes (dimensions) specified by ``axis`` must be included in the result as singleton dimensions, and, accordingly, the result must be compatible with the input array (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Otherwise, if ``False``, the axes (dimensions) specified by ``axis`` must not be included in the result. Default: ``False``.
    ord: Union[int, float, Literal[inf, -inf]]
        order of the norm. The following mathematical norms must be supported:

        +------------------+----------------------------+
        | ord              | description                |
        +==================+============================+
        | 1                | L1-norm (Manhattan)        |
        +------------------+----------------------------+
        | 2                | L2-norm (Euclidean)        |
        +------------------+----------------------------+
        | inf              | infinity norm              |
        +------------------+----------------------------+
        | (int,float >= 1) | p-norm                     |
        +------------------+----------------------------+

        The following non-mathematical "norms" must be supported:

        +------------------+--------------------------------+
        | ord              | description                    |
        +==================+================================+
        | 0                | sum(a != 0)                    |
        +------------------+--------------------------------+
        | -1               | 1./sum(1./abs(a))              |
        +------------------+--------------------------------+
        | -2               | 1./sqrt(sum(1./abs(a)\*\*2))   |
        +------------------+--------------------------------+
        | -inf             | min(abs(a))                    |
        +------------------+--------------------------------+
        | (int,float < 1)  | sum(abs(a)\*\*ord)\*\*(1./ord) |
        +------------------+--------------------------------+

        Default: ``2``.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the vector norms. If ``axis`` is ``None``, the returned array must be a zero-dimensional array containing a vector norm. If ``axis`` is a scalar value (``int`` or ``float``), the returned array must have a rank which is one less than the rank of ``x``. If ``axis`` is a ``n``-tuple, the returned array must have a rank which is ``n`` less than the rank of ``x``. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

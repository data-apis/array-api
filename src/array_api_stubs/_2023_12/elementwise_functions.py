def abs(x: array, /) -> array:
    r"""
    Calculates the absolute value for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    For real-valued input arrays, the element-wise result has the same magnitude as the respective element in ``x`` but has positive sign.

    .. note::
       For signed integer data types, the absolute value of the minimum representable integer is implementation-dependent.

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, the complex absolute value is known as the norm, modulus, or magnitude and, for a complex number :math:`z = a + bj` is computed as

       .. math::
          \operatorname{abs}(z) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, conforming implementations should take care to avoid undue overflow or underflow during intermediate stages of computation.

    ..
       TODO: once ``hypot`` is added to the specification, remove the special cases for complex floating-point operands and the note concerning guarding against undue overflow/underflow, and state that special cases must be handled as if implemented as ``hypot(real(x), imag(x))``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array. Should have a numeric data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the absolute value of each element in ``x``. If ``x`` has a real-valued data type, the returned array must have the same data type as ``x``. If ``x`` has a complex floating-point data type, the returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type whose precision matches the precision of ``x`` (e.g., if ``x`` is ``complex128``, then the returned array must have a ``float64`` data type).

    Notes
    -----

    **Special Cases**

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+infinity``.

    For complex floating-point operands, let ``a = real(x_i)``, ``b = imag(x_i)``, and

    - If ``a`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``b`` is any value (including ``NaN``), the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``a`` is any value (including ``NaN``) and ``b`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``a`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equal to ``abs(b)``.
    - If ``b`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equal to ``abs(a)``.

If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an `infinity` of appropriate mathematical sign.

    .. note::
       Floating-point addition is a commutative operation, but not always associative.

    For complex floating-point operands, addition is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    |            | c          | dj         | c + dj         |

    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    | **bj**     | c + bj     | (b+d)j     | c + (b+d)j     |
    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a+c) + bj | a + (b+d)j | (a+c) + (b+d)j |
    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+

    For complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table. For example, let ``a = real(x1_i)``, ``b = imag(x1_i)``, ``c = real(x2_i)``, ``d = imag(x2_i)``, and

    - If ``a`` is ``-0`` and ``c`` is ``-0``, the real component of the result is ``-0``.
    - Similarly, if ``b`` is ``+0`` and ``d`` is ``-0``, the imaginary component of the result is ``+0``.

    Hence, if ``z1 = a + bj = -0 + 0j`` and ``z2 = c + dj = -0 - 0j``, the result of ``z1 + z2`` is ``-0 + 0j``.

The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen such that each element-wise result is the signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and passing through the point ``(1,0)`` and the ray ending at the origin and passing through the point ``(x2_i, x1_i)``.

    .. note::
       Note the role reversal: the "y-coordinate" is the first function parameter; the "x-coordinate" is the second function parameter. The parameter order is intentional and traditional for the two-argument inverse tangent function where the y-coordinate argument is first and the x-coordinate argument is second.

    By IEEE 754 convention, the inverse tangent of the quotient ``x1/x2`` is defined for ``x2_i`` equal to positive or negative zero and for either or both of ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` equal to positive or negative ``infinity``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1: array
        input array corresponding to the y-coordinates. Should have a real-valued floating-point data type.
    x2: array
        input array corresponding to the x-coordinates. Must be compatible with ``x1`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Should have a real-valued floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the inverse tangent of the quotient ``x1/x2``. The returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def atanh(x: array, /) -> array:
    r"""
    Calculates an implementation-dependent approximation to the inverse hyperbolic tangent for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    .. note::
       The principal value of the inverse hyperbolic tangent of a complex number :math:`z` is

       .. math::
          \operatorname{atanh}(z) = \frac{\ln(1+z)-\ln(z-1)}{2}

       For any :math:`z`,

       .. math::
          \operatorname{atanh}(z) = \frac{\operatorname{atan}(zj)}{j}

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, ``atanh(conj(x))`` must equal ``conj(atanh(x))`` and ``atanh(-x)`` must equal ``-atanh(x)``.

    .. note::
       The inverse hyperbolic tangent is a multi-valued function and requires a branch cut on the complex plane. By convention, a branch cut is placed at the line segments :math:`(-\infty, 1]` and :math:`[1, \infty)` of the real axis.

       Accordingly, for complex arguments, the function returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent in the range of a half-strip unbounded along the real axis and in the interval :math:`[-\pi j/2, +\pi j/2]` along the imaginary axis.

       *Note: branch cuts follow C99 and have provisional status* (see :ref:`branch-cuts`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array whose elements each represent the area of a hyperbolic sector. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the inverse hyperbolic tangent of each element in ``x``. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    For complex floating-point operands, division is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    |            | c              | dj              | c + dj                   |
    +============+================+=================+==========================+
    | **a**      | a / c          | -(a/d)j         | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **bj**     | (b/c)j         | b/d             | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a/c) + (b/c)j | b/d - (a/d)j    | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+

    In general, for complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table.

    When ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` are all finite numbers (i.e., a value other than ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``), division of complex floating-point operands should be computed as if calculated according to the textbook formula for complex number division

    .. math::
       \frac{a + bj}{c + dj} = \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)j}{c^2 + d^2}

    When at least one of ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` is ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``,

    - If ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, and ``d`` are all ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - In the remaining cases, the result is implementation dependent.

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, the results of special cases may be implementation dependent depending on how an implementation chooses to model complex numbers and complex infinity (e.g., complex plane versus Riemann sphere). For those implementations following C99 and its one-infinity model, when at least one component is infinite, even if the other component is ``NaN``, the complex value is infinite, and the usual arithmetic rules do not apply to complex-complex division. In the interest of performance, other implementations may want to avoid the complex branching logic necessary to implement the one-infinity model and choose to implement all complex-complex division according to the textbook formula. Accordingly, special case behavior is unlikely to be consistent across implementations.

    **Special cases**

    .. note::
       Floor division was introduced in Python via `PEP 238 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/>`_ with the goal to disambiguate "true division" (i.e., computing an approximation to the mathematical operation of division) from "floor division" (i.e., rounding the result of division toward negative infinity). The former was computed when one of the operands was a ``float``, while the latter was computed when both operands were ``int``\s. Overloading the ``/`` operator to support both behaviors led to subtle numerical bugs when integers are possible, but not expected.

       To resolve this ambiguity, ``/`` was designated for true division, and ``//`` was designated for floor division. Semantically, floor division was `defined <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/#semantics-of-floor-division>`_ as equivalent to ``a // b == floor(a/b)``; however, special floating-point cases were left ill-defined.

       Accordingly, floor division is not implemented consistently across array libraries for some of the special cases documented below. Namely, when one of the operands is ``infinity``, libraries may diverge with some choosing to strictly follow ``floor(a/b)`` and others choosing to pair ``//`` with ``%`` according to the relation ``b = a % b + b * (a // b)``. The special cases leading to divergent behavior are documented below.

       This specification prefers floor division to match ``floor(divide(x1, x2))`` in order to avoid surprising and unexpected results; however, array libraries may choose to more strictly follow Python behavior.

    For floating-point operands,

    - If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``-infinity``.

    - If ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x1_i`` is any value, including ``NaN``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equivalent to ``abs(x2_i)``.
    - If ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equivalent to ``abs(x1_i)``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a finite number or ``NaN`` and ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x2_i`` is a finite number or ``NaN`` and ``x1_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - Underflow may only occur when both arguments are subnormal and the correct result is also subnormal.

    For real-valued floating-point operands, ``hypot(x1, x2)`` must equal ``hypot(x2, x1)``, ``hypot(x1, -x2)``, ``hypot(-x1, x2)``, and ``hypot(-x1, -x2)``.

    .. note::
       IEEE 754-2019 requires support for subnormal (a.k.a., denormal) numbers, which are useful for supporting gradual underflow. However, hardware support for subnormal numbers is not universal, and many platforms (e.g., accelerators) and compilers support toggling denormals-are-zero (DAZ) and/or flush-to-zero (FTZ) behavior to increase performance and to guard against timing attacks.

    - If ``x1_i`` is a nonzero finite number and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``infinity`` nor ``NaN`` is involved, the product must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the result is an `infinity` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    For complex floating-point operands, multiplication is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    |            | c              | dj              | c + dj                   |
    +============+================+=================+==========================+
    | **a**      | a * c          | (a*d)j          | (a*c) + (a*d)j           |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **bj**     | (b*c)j         | -(b*d)          | -(b*d) + (b*c)j          |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a*c) + (b*c)j | -(b*d) + (a*d)j | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+

    In general, for complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table.

    When ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` are all finite numbers (i.e., a value other than ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``), multiplication of complex floating-point operands should be computed as if calculated according to the textbook formula for complex number multiplication

    .. math::
       (a + bj) \cdot (c + dj) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)j

    When at least one of ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` is ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``,

    - If ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, and ``d`` are all ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - In the remaining cases, the result is implementation dependent.

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, the results of special cases may be implementation dependent depending on how an implementation chooses to model complex numbers and complex infinity (e.g., complex plane versus Riemann sphere). For those implementations following C99 and its one-infinity model, when at least one component is infinite, even if the other component is ``NaN``, the complex value is infinite, and the usual arithmetic rules do not apply to complex-complex multiplication. In the interest of performance, other implementations may want to avoid the complex branching logic necessary to implement the one-infinity model and choose to implement all complex-complex multiplication according to the textbook formula. Accordingly, special case behavior is unlikely to be consistent across implementations.

    Squares each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    The square of a number ``x_i`` is defined as

       x_i^2 = x_i \cdot x_i

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array. Should have a numeric data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the evaluated result for each element in ``x``. The returned array must have a data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def sqrt(x: array, /) -> array:

    Calculates the principal square root for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    .. note::
       After rounding, each result must be indistinguishable from the infinitely precise result (as required by IEEE 754).

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, ``sqrt(conj(x))`` must equal ``conj(sqrt(x))``.

    .. note::
       By convention, the branch cut of the square root is the negative real axis :math:`(-\infty, 0)`.

       The square root is a continuous function from above the branch cut, taking into account the sign of the imaginary component.

       Accordingly, for complex arguments, the function returns the square root in the range of the right half-plane, including the imaginary axis (i.e., the plane defined by :math:`[0, +\infty)` along the real axis and :math:`(-\infty, +\infty)` along the imaginary axis).

       *Note: branch cuts follow C99 and have provisional status* (see :ref:`branch-cuts`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------

def tan(x: array, /) -> array:

    Calculates an implementation-dependent approximation to the tangent for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    .. note::
       Tangent is an analytical function on the complex plane and has no branch cuts. The function is periodic, with period :math:`\pi j`, with respect to the real component and has first order poles along the real line at coordinates :math:`(\pi (\frac{1}{2} + n), 0)`.

       For complex arguments, the mathematical definition of tangent is

    - If ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0 + 0j``.
    - If ``a`` is a nonzero finite number and ``b`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0 + NaN j``.

    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is ``+0``, the result is ``NaN + 0j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is a nonzero number, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.

    .. warning::
       For historical reasons stemming from the C standard, array libraries may not return the expected result when ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``NaN``. The result should be ``+0 + NaN j`` in both cases; however, for libraries compiled against older C versions, the result may be ``NaN + NaN j``.

       Array libraries are not required to patch these older C versions, and, thus, users are advised that results may vary across array library implementations for these special cases.

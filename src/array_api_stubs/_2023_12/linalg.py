def cholesky(x: array, /, *, upper: bool = False) -> array:
    r"""
    Returns the lower (upper) Cholesky decomposition of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric positive-definite matrix ``x``.

    If ``x`` is real-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of real numbers :math:`\mathbb{R}`, and, if ``x`` is complex-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of complex numbers :math:`\mathbb{C}`.

    The lower **Cholesky decomposition** of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric positive-definite matrix :math:`x \in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}` is defined as

    .. math::
       x = LL^{H} \qquad \text{L $\in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$}

    where :math:`L` is a lower triangular matrix and :math:`L^{H}` is the conjugate transpose when :math:`L` is complex-valued and the transpose when :math:`L` is real-valued.

    The upper Cholesky decomposition is defined similarly

    .. math::
       x = U^{H}U \qquad \text{U $\in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$}

    where :math:`U` is an upper triangular matrix.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the Cholesky decomposition for each matrix in the stack.

    .. note::
       Whether an array library explicitly checks whether an input array is Hermitian or a symmetric positive-definite matrix (or a stack of matrices) is implementation-defined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, M)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form square complex Hermitian or real symmetric positive-definite matrices. Should have a floating-point data type.
    upper: bool
        If ``True``, the result must be the upper-triangular Cholesky factor :math:`U`. If ``False``, the result must be the lower-triangular Cholesky factor :math:`L`. Default: ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the Cholesky factors for each square matrix. If ``upper`` is ``False``, the returned array must contain lower-triangular matrices; otherwise, the returned array must contain upper-triangular matrices. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion` and must have the same shape as ``x``.

    Returns the cross product of 3-element vectors.

    If ``x1`` and/or ``x2`` are multi-dimensional arrays (i.e., the broadcasted result has a rank greater than ``1``), then the cross-product of each pair of corresponding 3-element vectors is independently computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1: array

    The **eigenvalue decomposition** of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric matrix :math:`x \in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}` is defined as

    .. math::
       x = Q \Lambda Q^H

    with :math:`Q \in \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}` and :math:`\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^n` and where :math:`Q^H` is the conjugate transpose when :math:`Q` is complex and the transpose when :math:`Q` is real-valued and :math:`\Lambda` is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues. When ``x`` is real-valued, :math:`Q` is orthogonal, and, when ``x`` is complex, :math:`Q` is unitary.

    .. note::
       The eigenvalues of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric matrix are always real.

    .. warning::
       The eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix are not unique and are not continuous with respect to ``x``. Because eigenvectors are not unique, different hardware and software may compute different eigenvectors.

       Non-uniqueness stems from the fact that multiplying an eigenvector by :math:`-1` when ``x`` is real-valued and by :math:`e^{\phi j}` (:math:`\phi \in \mathbb{R}`) when ``x`` is complex produces another set of valid eigenvectors.

    The **complete QR decomposition** of a matrix :math:`x \in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}` is defined as

    .. math::
       x = QR

    where :math:`Q \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times m}` is orthogonal when ``x`` is real-valued and unitary when ``x`` is complex-valued and where :math:`R \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}` is an upper triangular matrix with real diagonal (even when ``x`` is complex-valued).

    When :math:`m \gt n` (tall matrix), as :math:`R` is upper triangular, the last :math:`m - n` rows are zero. In this case, the last :math:`m - n` columns of :math:`Q` can be dropped to form the **reduced QR decomposition**.

    .. note::
       Whether an array library explicitly checks whether an input array is a full column rank matrix (or a stack of full column rank matrices) is implementation-defined.

    .. warning::
       The elements in the diagonal of :math:`R` are not necessarily positive. Accordingly, the returned QR decomposition is only unique up to the sign of the diagonal of :math:`R`, and different libraries or inputs on different devices may produce different valid decompositions.

        -   ``'reduced'``: compute only the leading ``K`` columns of ``q``, such that ``q`` and ``r`` have dimensions ``(..., M, K)`` and ``(..., K, N)``, respectively, and where ``K = min(M, N)``.
        -   ``'complete'``: compute ``q`` and ``r`` with dimensions ``(..., M, M)`` and ``(..., M, N)``, respectively.

        Default: ``'reduced'``.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Tuple[array, array]
        a namedtuple ``(Q, R)`` whose

        -   first element must have the field name ``Q`` and must be an array whose shape depends on the value of ``mode`` and contain matrices with orthonormal columns. If ``mode`` is ``'complete'``, the array must have shape ``(..., M, M)``. If ``mode`` is ``'reduced'``, the array must have shape ``(..., M, K)``, where ``K = min(M, N)``. The first ``x.ndim-2`` dimensions must have the same size as those of the input array ``x``.
        -   second element must have the field name ``R`` and must be an array whose shape depends on the value of ``mode`` and contain upper-triangular matrices. If ``mode`` is ``'complete'``, the array must have shape ``(..., M, N)``. If ``mode`` is ``'reduced'``, the array must have shape ``(..., K, N)``, where ``K = min(M, N)``. The first ``x.ndim-2`` dimensions must have the same size as those of the input ``x``.

        Each returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def slogdet(x: array, /) -> Tuple[array, array]:
    r"""
    Returns the sign and the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant of a square matrix (or a stack of square matrices) ``x``.

    .. note::
       The purpose of this function is to calculate the determinant more accurately when the determinant is either very small or very large, as calling ``det`` may overflow or underflow.

    The sign of the determinant is given by

    .. math::
       \operatorname{sign}(\det x) = \begin{cases}
       0 & \textrm{if } \det x = 0 \\
       \frac{\det x}{|\det x|} & \textrm{otherwise}
       \end{cases}

    where :math:`|\det x|` is the absolute value of the determinant of ``x``.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the sign and natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant for each matrix in the stack.

    **Special Cases**

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If the determinant is zero, the ``sign`` should be ``0`` and ``logabsdet`` should be ``-infinity``.

    For complex floating-point operands,

    - If the determinant is ``0 + 0j``, the ``sign`` should be ``0 + 0j`` and ``logabsdet`` should be ``-infinity + 0j``.

    .. note::
       Depending on the underlying algorithm, when the determinant is zero, the returned result may differ from ``-infinity`` (or ``-infinity + 0j``). In all cases, the determinant should be equal to ``sign * exp(logabsdet)`` (although, again, the result may be subject to numerical precision errors).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, M)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form square matrices. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Tuple[array, array]
        a namedtuple (``sign``, ``logabsdet``) whose

        -   first element must have the field name ``sign`` and must be an array containing a number representing the sign of the determinant for each square matrix. Must have the same data type as ``x``.
        -   second element must have the field name ``logabsdet`` and must be an array containing the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant for each square matrix. If ``x`` is real-valued, the returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`. If ``x`` is complex, the returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type having the same precision as ``x`` (e.g., if ``x`` is ``complex64``, ``logabsdet`` must have a ``float32`` data type).

        Each returned array must have shape ``shape(x)[:-2]``.

def solve(x1: array, x2: array, /) -> array:
    r"""
    Returns the solution of a square system of linear equations with a unique solution.

    Let ``x1`` equal :math:`A` and ``x2`` equal :math:`B`. If the promoted data type of ``x1`` and ``x2`` is real-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of real numbers :math:`\mathbb{R}`, and, if the promoted data type of ``x1`` and ``x2`` is complex-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of complex numbers :math:`\mathbb{C}`.

    This function computes the solution :math:`X \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times k}` of the **linear system** associated to :math:`A \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times m}` and :math:`B \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times k}` and is defined as

    .. math::
       AX = B

    This system of linear equations has a unique solution if and only if :math:`A` is invertible.

    .. note::
       Whether an array library explicitly checks whether ``x1`` is invertible is implementation-defined.

    When ``x1`` and/or ``x2`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute a solution for each matrix in the stack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1: array
        coefficient array ``A`` having shape ``(..., M, M)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form square matrices. Must be of full rank (i.e., all rows or, equivalently, columns must be linearly independent). Should have a floating-point data type.
    x2: array
        ordinate (or "dependent variable") array ``B``. If ``x2`` has shape ``(M,)``, ``x2`` is equivalent to an array having shape ``(..., M, 1)``. If ``x2`` has shape ``(..., M, K)``, each column ``k`` defines a set of ordinate values for which to compute a solution, and ``shape(x2)[:-2]`` must be compatible with ``shape(x1)[:-2]`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the solution to the system ``AX = B`` for each square matrix. If ``x2`` has shape ``(M,)``, the returned array must have shape equal to ``shape(x1)[:-2] + shape(x2)[-1:]``. Otherwise, if ``x2`` has shape ``(..., M, K)```, the returned array must have shape equal to ``(..., M, K)``, where ``...`` refers to the result of broadcasting ``shape(x1)[:-2]`` and ``shape(x2)[:-2]``. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def svd(x: array, /, *, full_matrices: bool = True) -> Tuple[array, array, array]:
    r"""
    Returns a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix (or a stack of matrices) ``x``.

    If ``x`` is real-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of real numbers :math:`\mathbb{R}`, and, if ``x`` is complex-valued, let :math:`\mathbb{K}` be the set of complex numbers :math:`\mathbb{C}`.

    The full **singular value decomposition** of an :math:`m \times n` matrix :math:`x \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}` is a factorization of the form

    .. math::
       x = U \Sigma V^H

    where :math:`U \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times m}`, :math:`\Sigma \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times\ n}`, :math:`\operatorname{diag}(\Sigma) \in\ \mathbb{R}^{k}` with :math:`k = \operatorname{min}(m, n)`, :math:`V^H \in\ \mathbb{K}^{n \times n}`, and where :math:`V^H` is the conjugate transpose when :math:`V` is complex and the transpose when :math:`V` is real-valued. When ``x`` is real-valued, :math:`U`, :math:`V` (and thus :math:`V^H`) are orthogonal, and, when ``x`` is complex, :math:`U`, :math:`V` (and thus :math:`V^H`) are unitary.

    When :math:`m \gt n` (tall matrix), we can drop the last :math:`m - n` columns of :math:`U` to form the reduced SVD

    .. math::
       x = U \Sigma V^H

    where :math:`U \in\ \mathbb{K}^{m \times k}`, :math:`\Sigma \in\ \mathbb{K}^{k \times\ k}`, :math:`\operatorname{diag}(\Sigma) \in\ \mathbb{R}^{k}`, and :math:`V^H \in\ \mathbb{K}^{k \times n}`. In this case, :math:`U` and :math:`V` have orthonormal columns.

    Similarly, when :math:`n \gt m` (wide matrix), we can drop the last :math:`n - m` columns of :math:`V` to also form a reduced SVD.

    This function returns the decomposition :math:`U`, :math:`S`, and :math:`V^H`, where :math:`S = \operatorname{diag}(\Sigma)`.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the singular value decomposition for each matrix in the stack.

    .. warning::
       The returned arrays :math:`U` and :math:`V` are neither unique nor continuous with respect to ``x``. Because :math:`U` and :math:`V` are not unique, different hardware and software may compute different singular vectors.

       Non-uniqueness stems from the fact that multiplying any pair of singular vectors :math:`u_k`, :math:`v_k` by :math:`-1` when ``x`` is real-valued and by :math:`e^{\phi j}` (:math:`\phi \in \mathbb{R}`) when ``x`` is complex produces another two valid singular vectors of the matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, N)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form matrices on which to perform singular value decomposition. Should have a floating-point data type.
    full_matrices: bool
        If ``True``, compute full-sized ``U`` and ``Vh``, such that ``U`` has shape ``(..., M, M)`` and ``Vh`` has shape ``(..., N, N)``. If ``False``, compute on the leading ``K`` singular vectors, such that ``U`` has shape ``(..., M, K)`` and ``Vh`` has shape ``(..., K, N)`` and where ``K = min(M, N)``. Default: ``True``.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Tuple[array, array, array]
        a namedtuple ``(U, S, Vh)`` whose

        -   first element must have the field name ``U`` and must be an array whose shape depends on the value of ``full_matrices`` and contain matrices with orthonormal columns (i.e., the columns are left singular vectors). If ``full_matrices`` is ``True``, the array must have shape ``(..., M, M)``. If ``full_matrices`` is ``False``, the array must have shape ``(..., M, K)``, where ``K = min(M, N)``. The first ``x.ndim-2`` dimensions must have the same shape as those of the input ``x``. Must have the same data type as ``x``.
        -   second element must have the field name ``S`` and must be an array with shape ``(..., K)`` that contains the vector(s) of singular values of length ``K``, where ``K = min(M, N)``. For each vector, the singular values must be sorted in descending order by magnitude, such that ``s[..., 0]`` is the largest value, ``s[..., 1]`` is the second largest value, et cetera. The first ``x.ndim-2`` dimensions must have the same shape as those of the input ``x``. Must have a real-valued floating-point data type having the same precision as ``x`` (e.g., if ``x`` is ``complex64``, ``S`` must have a ``float32`` data type).
        -   third element must have the field name ``Vh`` and must be an array whose shape depends on the value of ``full_matrices`` and contain orthonormal rows (i.e., the rows are the right singular vectors and the array is the adjoint). If ``full_matrices`` is ``True``, the array must have shape ``(..., N, N)``. If ``full_matrices`` is ``False``, the array must have shape ``(..., K, N)`` where ``K = min(M, N)``. The first ``x.ndim-2`` dimensions must have the same shape as those of the input ``x``. Must have the same data type as ``x``.

    offset: int
        offset specifying the off-diagonal relative to the main diagonal.

        Default: ``0``.
    dtype: Optional[dtype]
        data type of the returned array.

        If the data type (either specified or resolved) differs from the data type of ``x``, the input array should be cast to the specified data type before computing the sum (rationale: the ``dtype`` keyword argument is intended to help prevent overflows). Default: ``None``.

    Returns

    out: array
        an array containing the traces and whose shape is determined by removing the last two dimensions and storing the traces in the last array dimension.

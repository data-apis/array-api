# Contributing to the Array API Standard

Thank you for your interest in contributing!


## Contributing

If you would like to contribute textual clarifications or other "maintenance
type" changes, please open a pull request on the
https://github.com/data-apis/array-api repository.

If you would like to add more functionality to the Array API Standard, please
take note of:
- the Scope section of the standard
- the [document outlining the Consortium's Process for standardization](https://github.com/data-apis/governance/blob/master/process_document.md)
before opening a pull request. If your proposed addition seems in scope,
opening an issue for discussion may be more appropriate as a first step.
